      <h1>A Grocery Store Garlic Obession</h1>
      <h2>At first you might think that Pro. Patterson was kidding. A little commentary about garlic mentioned here. A little 
          commentary about garlic mentioned here. A little anecodte in passing there. Upon relfection, however, it would 
          become clear that the mentions belied a deep set obession with the odiforous bulb. Making many question 
          whether there was vampire trauma in his past.</h2>
